            </h2>
            <p>I am an entrepreneur who runs two businesses: Binomial, focused on image compression tech, and Art by Stephanie Hurlburt, where I sell art I make that often involves technology. I am so passionate about tech being a very creative field and using my knowledge of technology to create beauty in people's lives. I'm also passionate about business and the independence and freedom people can get by learning a little more about sales.</p>
            <h3>Build & Sell What You Want, Now: Business, Art, Tech, and more!</h3>
            <p>"I can't be an entrepreneur because I'm not even a senior level at work yet" is a common myth I hear. I want to encourage everyone listening to build what they want now, not later, and start trying to sell it now, not later. I'll share my personal experiences around bootstrapping a successful tech company and pursuing my passions in hopes it sparks you to do the same.</p>
