   <h3>Make your own IoTshirt</h3>
   <p>Ever wanted your clothing to respond to the music you’re listening to? How about the latest news or the weather? With a bit of JS and some soldering, it can! This talk will cover how to make your own wearable LED display using a microcontroller and hook it up to the internet. Then we’ll learn how to control it with data, node.js and some arduino code. All suitable for absolute beginners! I’ll help you to avoid some of the silly mistakes I made while working on my first wearable and encourage you to give IoT a try!</p>
