   <p>Chiu-Ki Chan is an Android developer who enjoys mostly geeky hobbies like board games, puzzles and escape rooms. She never thought of herself as an artist, until she was introduced to sketchnoting. Through sketchnoting, she discovered that drawing is not some innate ability that you are either born with or without, but rather a skill that everyone can learn. And she delights in sharing this discovery with her fellow geeks.</p>
   <h3>Yes, you can draw with your engineering brain</h3>
   <p>Left brain vs right brain. Logic vs creativity. We tend to see tech and art as opposites, that you can do either one or the other. But it doesn't have to be that way. In this talk, I will share how I reframe drawing as a constraint satisfaction problem, and apply my engineering skills to express myself visually.</p>
