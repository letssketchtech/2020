                <p>Sketches are great for a Saturday conference, but do we really need doodling skills during the week? In this workshop, Marlena Compton shows attendees what happens when doodling goes to work and turns into (drumroll please...) visual communication! Attendees will learn when their doodles can really make a difference during the workday and how to use their basic doodling skills for the workplace environment.
